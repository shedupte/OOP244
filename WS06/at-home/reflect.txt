Reflection Week 6 

1. If the source and current object share the same address, then that can pose some errors, specifically when we 
   deallocate the current object, it would also deaalocate all the data in the source as well. By checking for self-assignment
   we ensure that we do not lose the source data, when using the copy assignment operator.

2. By using the Copy assignment operator multiple times, we increased the size of the phonenumber array as we added each new number.
   This allowed us to avoid writing and rewriting phone number array over and over again.

3. We learned how to define a copy constructor and copy assigment operator.
   Also how to define a destructor
