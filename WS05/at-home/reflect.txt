Reflect Workshop 5 

1. The Operator+ returns a Fraction Object because we are making a new object and not modifying an old one. A reference is used when you are passing the address of another object to be modified.

2. (a+b) (b+d)

3. The isEmpty() was used multiply time when we needed to check if the fractions were in a non-empty safe state. Also the constructors help to ensure that the data members were in a safe empty state multiply times as well.

4. We learned in this work shop how to over load an operator as a member function. We also had to use member functions and within them access current objects. finally we learned how to identify the lifetime of a temporary object and other objects.
